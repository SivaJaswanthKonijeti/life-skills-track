## Question 2 - In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
  * The video's most noteworthy feature is Barbara Oakley's personal story about suffering with maths throughout her childhood.
  * She describes how she avoided maths entirely, even pursuing a vocation that did not require it.
  * Later in life, she decided to retrain her brain and study maths from the start, proving that talent is not fixed.
  * She transformed a weakness into a strength by employing certain learning approaches, such as moving between concentrated and dispersed modes.
  * This story demonstrates that with the appropriate techniques, practice, and perspective, anyone can learn anything, irrespective of their starting point.

## Question 3 - What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
Active Mode:
  * This is when our brain is fully concentrating on one thing.
  * You use it when you are studying, solving a problem, or coding seriously.

Diffused Mode: 
  * This is when our brain is relaxed and not focusing hard.
  * It happens when you are walking, showering, resting, or daydreaming.

## Question 4 - According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.
  * Break the skill into smaller parts.
  * Remove all distractions and barriers to practice.
  * Commit to at least 20 hours of focused practice.
  * Learn just enough to gain confidence and self-correct.

## Question 5 - What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
I can take the following actions to improve my learning process:
  * Breaking big topics into small.
  * Focusing on the most important sub-skills first.
  * Learning just enough theory to start practising quickly.
  * Removing distractions while studying or practising.
  * Review what I learned after a few hours or the next day.
