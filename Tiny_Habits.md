# Tiny Habits

### Question 1 - In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
- I liked the idea that big life changes actually start with very tiny steps, not huge plans.
- The story about doing just two push-ups a day stood out to me. It felt so small, but it slowly turned into a real fitness habit.
- The message that tiny habits can grow into big identity changes really inspired me.

### Question 2 - How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
- Behavior happens only when Motivation, Ability, and Prompt come together at the same time.
- If any one of them is missing, the habit will not happen.
- To make habits easier, don’t try to increase motivation. Try to make the habit easier to do.
- Motivation (M) = the desire I feel in that moment. It goes up and down.
- Ability (A) = how easy the habit is. If it’s simple and tiny, I will actually do it.
- Prompt (P) = the reminder or trigger that tells me “do it now.”

### Question 3 - Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
- Celebration makes our brain feel good, which helps the new habit be adopted faster.
- When we celebrate, our brain releases a small burst of positive emotion.
- Whatever we celebrate, we repeat. Celebration turns a tiny action into a habit.
- Celebration makes even a small step feel meaningful, keeping us motivated to continue.
- Even a small celebration makes us adopt that particular habit over time.
- It helps our mind connect the habit with success, not effort or stress.

### Question 4 - In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
- The story about British Cycling was the most inspiring about how tiny improvements in dozens of small areas turned a losing team into world champions.
- It showed that small steps matter and even tiny changes, when repeated daily, can create huge results over time.
- I liked the idea that we don’t need a massive transformation, just 1% better every day, slowly shifting our entire life.
- It made me realize that big success is really just the result of many small, consistent wins adding up.

### Question 5 - What is the book's perspective about Identity?
- The book says real change starts with who you believe you are, not just what you want to achieve.
- Your habits slowly shape your identity. Every small action you take is a vote for the type of person you want to become.
- Instead of focusing on outcomes like I want to lose weight, focus on identity, like I am someone who takes care of my health.
- You grow into a new version of yourself by repeating actions that match the person you want to be.

### Question 6 - Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
- Make the habit small so it feels easy to start.
- A habit should be simple enough that you cannot say no to it.
- Cut down anything that makes the habit feel complicated or tiring.
- Use the two-minute rule. Begin every habit in a version that takes less than two minutes.
- Focus on showing up first. Once the habit becomes automatic, you can slowly make it bigger.
- The easier a habit is to begin, the more likely you are to keep doing it every day.

### Question 7 - Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
- Make the bad habit require more steps so it feels less convenient.
- Increase the distance between you and the habit.
- Remove the sources to get rid of the haits.
- Make the environment support the version of you who avoids the habit.
- Reduce the satisfaction you get from the habit.

### Question 8 - Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
- I want to make a habit of practicing coding daily.
- I will keep my laptop open on the coding screen when I finish the previous session.
- I will set a reminder every day at the same time.
- I will decide my coding time in advance, after dinner or early morning.
- I will choose problems that match my skill level so I don’t feel overwhelmed.
- I will start with just two minutes of coding or solving one small problem.
- I will remove distractions like phone notifications before I begin.
---
### Question 9 - Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
- A habit I want to reduce and eliminate over time is reducing my screen time.
- Turning off non-essential notifications.
- Remove distracting apps from the home screen.
- Think about what I lose by wasting time.
- Log out of social media apps.
- Delete apps that cause the most distraction.
- Reward myself only when I avoid unnecessary scrolling.
