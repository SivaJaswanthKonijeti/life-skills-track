- It encourages you to see challenges and mistakes as chances to grow, helping you stay motivated and become better over time.

## Question 3 - What is the Internal Locus of Control? What is the key point in the video?
- You stay motivated when you genuinely feel that your actions make a difference.
- When you believe your effort leads to real results, you naturally work harder, try new things, and push through challenges.
